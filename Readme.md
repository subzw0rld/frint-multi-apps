# Frint Multiple Apps POC

This is a POC to demonstrate the concept of Micro Frontend using Frint.js. 

The application consists of two React apps (foo and bar), one consists of a counter that gets incremented/decremented based on button click, while the other app simply toggles the color between green and red.

The two applications interact with each other such that the output of foo can be displayed in bar and vice versa.

## To run the app simply do the following

- yarn install
- yarn start
